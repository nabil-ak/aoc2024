# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. Here, I am documenting my journey through this exciting and challenging coding event, where I aim to solve each day's puzzle using Python.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that are released one per day from December 1st to December 25th. Each puzzle presents a unique challenge that requires logic, programming skills, and a bit of creativity to solve.

## Try It Yourself

Interested in solving these puzzles yourself? Visit [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and start your own coding adventure!

## My Approach

As a software developer, I find these puzzles an excellent way to sharpen my coding skills and problem-solving abilities. For this year's challenges, I have chosen Python due to its versatility and readability, making it a great choice for quick development and problem-solving.

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge will have its own folder, named `day-X`, where `X` represents the day of the challenge. Inside each folder, you will find:

- `solution-a.py`: The Python script containing my solution of the task a.
- `solution-b.py`: The Python script containing my solution of the task b.
- `input.txt`: The input data provided for the challenge.

## Usage

To run any of the solutions, navigate to the specific day's folder and run the Python script with:

```bash
python solution.py
